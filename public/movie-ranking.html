<h1>The Best Movies According to Andy</h1>
<h2>I've watched these over and over</h2>
<hr>
<p>It's not easy picking a top three when it comes to movies, I love so many. I can say that I do have 
    favourite genres. These include animation, thriller, end-of-the-world type stuff (bonus points if 
    there's a psychological thriller vibe to it like Don't Look Up or that one with Julia Roberts and the ship).
    I also love RomComs and action movies a whole lot. Hmm... maybe I don't have favourites at all.

<h3>1. World War Z</h3>
<p>Honestly, any end-of-the-world, humans-are-messing-up kind of movies are very close to the top of my list. 
    I watched this one so much that I noticed every cut scene when they changed the version that was available, 
    and I was unnecessarily upset about it. Along with this one are movies like I mentioned above and 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow. 
    Bonus points if the dialogue is witty. I'm a huge fan of of catastrophic climate change movies.</p>
<h3>2. Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>"Don't call me [kid]"<br>
    "There it is" <br>
    "Hobie you're not helping"<br>
    "Good"<br>
    This is possibly my favourite part of the entire movie and I will be taking no questions 
    because how do I even explain that? 
    I was going to choose a RomCom for number two and trust me, RomComs are up there.
    However, this movie blew my socks off. I love the combination of animation styles,
the rhetoric around politics and what is considered good, and who decides when "good" 
takes it a little too far. Such a good movie. AND THE END?! Big fan. 
</p>
<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>These movies make me cry EVERY time I watch them. Honestly, if we were talking top genres, animation
    would undoubtedly be number one on my list. It's hard to choose a favourite animation, but this one 
    really holds a special place in my heart. Maybe it's because Hiccup has the same identity crisis in 
    every one of them, just in different fonts. I love that reflection of how not linear healing is.
